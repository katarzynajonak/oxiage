The OxiAge is an interactive web application of cross-species database that connects our current knowledge on reversible proteome oxidation during aging in various eukaryotes. The OxiAge Database explores changes in the oxidation landscape of specific cysteine residues across different species based on mass spectrometry results from chronologically aged yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, adult worms <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, fruit flies <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and mice <i>Mus musculus</i>.

The OxiAge Database serves as a basis for researchers to explore evolutionarily conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues differently modified at specific stages of aging.
